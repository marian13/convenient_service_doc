title: Why `case/when` does NOT work with just result codes?
---

Sometimes it may feel idiomatic to check the result code in the following way:

```ruby
# wrong
if result.not_success?
  case result.code # `result.code` returns fancy object
  when :full_queue
    notify_devops
  when :duplicated_job
    notify_devs
  else
    # ...
  end
end
```

Although this snippet looks very appealing, it won't work as expected.

A lot of Ruby folks often have an assumption that a value of `case` is compared with a value of `when`.

```ruby
case value === when value
```

In other words, the `case/when` from example above can be transformed to `if/else` like so:

```ruby
# wrong
if result.not_success?
  if result.code === :full_queue
    notify_devops
  elsif result.code === :duplicated_job
    notify_devs
  else
    # ...
  end
end
```

But, that is NOT correct.

In reality, the value of `when` is [always compared](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4467823/12201472) with the value of `case`.

```ruby
when value === case value
```

Let's write the proper transformation:

```ruby
# okish
if result.not_success?
  if :full_queue === result.code
    notify_devops
  elsif :duplicated_job === result.code
    notify_devs
  else
    # ...
  end
end
```

[Symbol#===](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Symbol.html#method-i-3D-3D-3D) is just an alias to [Symbol#==](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Symbol.html#method-i-3D-3D).

There is no way to hook into any behavior like with strings ([String#===](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/String.html#method-i-3D-3D-3D) calls [to_str](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/String.html#method-i-to_str) on its argument).

As a result, just `case result.code` is not enough.

But once you use `case result.code.to_sym`, the natural Ruby charm is back.

```ruby
# ok
if result.not_success?
  case result.code.to_sym
  when :full_queue
    notify_devops
  when :duplicated_job
    notify_devs
  else
    # ...
  end
end
```
