Consider a service that includes the `AwesomePrintInspect` config.

Here is the minimal example.

```ruby
ConvenientService::Dependencies.require_awesome_print_inspect

class Service
  include ::ConvenientService::Standard::Config
  include ::ConvenientService::AwesomePrintInspect::Config

  def result
    success(foo: :bar, baz: :qux)
  end
end
```

When it is called from the console like [IRB](https://github.com/ruby/irb).

```ruby
Service.result
```

The result should be pretty-printed by [awesome_print](https://github.com/awesome-print/awesome_print).

But it actually outputs some ["weird escape characters"](https://colors.sh) `^[[0;37m`, `^[[0m` or `^[[0;33m` like in the screenshot below.

One way to fix that problem is to [activate Awesome Print IRB integration](https://github.com/awesome-print/awesome_print?tab=readme-ov-file#irb-integration).

```ruby
AwesomePrint.irb!
```

Thus the output is colorized as expected.

In case you are using [Pry](https://github.com/pry/pry), [Awesome Print has integration for it](https://github.com/awesome-print/awesome_print?tab=readme-ov-file#pry-integration) as well.

```ruby
AwesomePrint.pry!
```
