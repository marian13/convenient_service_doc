Consider a service that includes the `AmazingPrintInspect` configuration.

Here is a minimal example.

```ruby
ConvenientService::Dependencies.require_amazing_print_inspect

class Service
  include ::ConvenientService::Standard::Config
  include ::ConvenientService::AmazingPrintInspect::Config

  def result
    success(foo: :bar, baz: :qux)
  end
end
```

When it is called from the console like [IRB](https://github.com/ruby/irb).

```ruby
Service.result
```

The result should be pretty-printed by [amazing_print](https://github.com/amazing-print/amazing_print).

But it actually outputs some ["weird escape characters"](https://colors.sh) `^[[0;37m`, `^[[0m`, or `^[[0;33m` like in the screenshot below.

After a deep diving into [IRB](https://github.com/ruby/irb) [source](https://github.com/ruby/irb/blob/v1.13.1/lib/irb/inspector.rb#L113) [code](https://github.com/ruby/irb/blob/v1.13.1/lib/irb/color.rb#L150), it was figured out that the issue may be caused by the upgrade of the [Reline](https://github.com/ruby/reline) gem from Ruby std lib.

To be more precise, the [`Reline::Unicode.escape_for_print`](https://github.com/ruby/reline/blob/v0.5.8/lib/reline/unicode.rb#L44C12-L44C28) method now has more escaping rules.

[One of them](https://github.com/ruby/reline/blob/v0.5.8/lib/reline/unicode.rb#L30) replaces `0x1B.ord` to `^[`.

That is why the coloring becomes broken.

There is one workaround to avoid the issue.

Check the following monkey patch.

```ruby
class Reline::Unicode
  def self.escape_for_print(str)
    str
  end
end
```

Once it is applied, the output is colorized as expected.

:::danger

Currently, it is not known which exact problem was solved by the Reline developers by [introducing additional escape rules](https://github.com/ruby/reline/commit/e7af054ba5ab8e749c92f9e5cf032f362ebbe747).

We are preparing to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ruby/reline/issues) to ask.

Consequently, although the suggested monkey patch looks safe, we can not estimate its possible negative effect.

Use it at your own risk.
