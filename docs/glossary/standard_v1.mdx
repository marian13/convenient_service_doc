[ConvenientService::Standard::V1::Config](https://github.com/marian13/convenient_service/blob/main/lib/convenient_service/service/configs/standard/v1.rb) is an outdated service configuration.

It was created as a reaction to the breaking change introduced between [ConvenientService](/) [`v0.13.0` and `v0.14.0` versions](https://github.com/marian13/convenient_service/commit/3125ee5b36e53223e25f744d83ee9959be9c2a36).

Its development is currently stopped and it won't receive any updates, except critical backports.

This config already lacks of new plugins for fallbacks and extended [ROP](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop) concepts.

And this list will grow up over time.

If you have any old services that are using [ConvenientService::Standard::V1::Config](https://github.com/marian13/convenient_service/blob/main/lib/convenient_service/service/configs/standard/v1.rb), please don't worry too much.

Luckily, [the migration process is pretty strightforward](/guides/advanced/how_to_migrate_from_standard_v1).
