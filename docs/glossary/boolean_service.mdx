- *Boolean service* is a service that confirms/denies the concrete assumption.

- *Boolean service* is a service that answers to the specific question.

- *Boolean service* is a service whose `success` result has no data.

`success` result from the boolean service confirms the assumption stated in its name.

In other words, it answers positively to the question.

`failure` result from the boolean service tells why exactly the assumption is NOT accurate.

In other words, it answers negatively to the question + provides the reason.

`error` result explains why there is no even hypothetical opportunity to confirm/deny the assumption.

In other words, it gives no answer to the question at all.

Here are some examples of such services:

```ruby
class IsEmployeeFree
  attr_reader :employee

  def initialize(employee:)
    @employee = employee
  end

  def result
    return error("Employee can't be blank") if employee.blank?
    return failure("Employee `#{employee.id}` has task `#{employee.tasks.find(&:in_progress?).id}` in progress") if employee.tasks.any?(&:in_progress?)

    success
  end
end
```

`IsEmployeeFree` assumes that an employee is available.

The following command either confirms or denies that assumption.

```ruby
IsEmployeeFree.success?(employee: employee)
```

```ruby
class IsTaskUnassigned
  attr_reader :task

  def initialize(task:)
    @task = task
  end

  def result
    return error("Task can't be blank") if task.blank?
    return failure("Task `#{task.id}` has employee `#{task.employee}`") if task.employee.present?

    success
  end
end
```

`IsTaskUnassigned` asks a question - is a task not assigned to anyone?

The expression below answers it either positively or negatively.

```ruby
IsEmployeeFree.success?(employee: employee)
```

Also as with any other type of service, the boolean service can be triggered via the `result` method or a step:

```ruby
result = IsEmployeeFree.result(employee: employee)
```

```ruby
class AssignTaskToEmployee
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  attr_reader :task, :employee

  step IsTaskUnassigned,
    in: :task

  step IsEmployeeFree,
    in: :employee

  def initialize(task:, employee:)
    @task = task
    @employee = employee
  end

  def result
    task.employee = employee

    saved = task.save

    return failure("Employee `#{employee.id}` is NOT saved to task `#{task.id}`") unless saved

    success
  end
end
```
