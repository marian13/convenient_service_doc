title: Decorator Middleware
---

A decorator middleware is a kind of middleware that always calls the next middleware in a chain.

[HasCallbacks](/api/plugins/common/has_callbacks) is a good example.

```ruby
module ConvenientService
  module Common
    module Plugins
      module HasCallbacks
        class Middleware < Core::MethodChainMiddleware
          # ...
          # highlight-start
          def next(...)
            entity.callbacks.for([:before, method]).each { |callback| callback.call_in_context(entity) }

            original_value = chain.next(...)

            entity.callbacks.for([:after, method]).reverse_each { |callback| callback.call_in_context(entity, original_value) }

            original_value
          end
          # highlight-end
          # ...
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

It triggers before callbacks, then `chain.next(...)`, and later after callbacks.

There are no conditionals that may skip `chain.next(...)` invocation.

That is why this middleware is considered [decorator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator) middleware.

In contrast, [proxy middlewares](/glossary/proxy_middleware) may not call `chain.next` if needed.
