*Entry* is a single part of the feature's [public interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interface).

Let's check the following feature class.

```ruby
module Application
  module Features
    class Gemfile
      include ConvenientService::Feature::Standard::Config

      entry :format do |path:|
        Services::Format.result(path: path)
      end

      entry :lint do |path:|
        Services::Lint.result(path: path)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

After a brief overview, you should start to have a high-level understanding of the goal of the `Gemfile` feature and what to do with it in practice.

In this particular case, two abilities are available:

- Formatting of a Gemfile (`entry :format`).

- Linting of a Gemfile (`entry :lint`).

Calling of an entry is as simple as:

```ruby
# Somewhere inside your codebase.
App::Features::Gemfile.format(path: "Gemfile")

App::Features::Gemfile.lint(path: "Gemfile")
```

That's why people are often thinking about entries as something really close to Ruby's regular class methods.

```ruby
##
# The actual entry.
#
entry :format do |path:|
  Services::Format.result(path: path)
end

##
# Just a mental concept to imagine entries as wrappers over class methods (under the hood they are something not so straightforward, but this is a topic for a different story).
#
def self.format(path:)
  Services::Format.result(path: path)
end
```

Eventually, a list of entries may and must be considered as a [Facade](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade) in front of the complex system.

:::tip

While having a code review of a new (or existing) feature, prefer to check its list of entries at the very beginning.

This is the way to quickly get a summary of the feature and its main purpose.

In other words, to get so-called ["minimal context"](/glossary/clean_code).

After that, the intention of the internal feature services may become more obvious (hopefully ðŸ™‚).

In order to find all feature triggers, just search for entries invocations using your favorite code editor.
