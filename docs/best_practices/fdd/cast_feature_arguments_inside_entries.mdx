title: Cast feature arguments inside entries
---

Usually, features have their own entities to represent their domain.

Entry is the best place where outside-world objects can be cast into them.

For example, consider the `User` entity for the `LoginSession` feature.

```ruby
module Features
  class LoginSession
    module Entities
      class User
        def initialize(email:, password:)
          @email = email
          @password = password
        end

        def self.cast(object)
          if object.instance_of?(::User)
            Entities::User.new(email: object.email_address, password: object.encrypted_password)
          else
            # ...
          end
        end

        # ...
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This is how an entry may convert a raw `user` object into feature specific entity.

```ruby
module Features
  class LoginSession
    include ConvenientService::Feature::Standard::Config

    def start(**kwargs)
      kwargs[:user] = Entities::User.cast(kwargs[:user])

      Services::Login.result(**kwargs)
    end
  end
end
```
