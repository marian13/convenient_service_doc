This way it becomes easier to get an overview of what a feature can do.

Here is an example of the `Gemfile` feature.

```ruby
module Features
  class Gemfile
    include ConvenientService::Feature::Standard::Config

    entry :format
    entry :lint
    entry :update
    entry :regenerate

    def format
      # ...
    end

    def lint
      # ...
    end

    def update
      # ...
    end

    def regenerate
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

Having a quick eye on the list of entries you immediately realize that there are abilities to `format`, `lint`, `update`, and `regenerate` Gemfiles.

Now, check out the `RequestParams` feature.

```ruby
module Features
  class RequestParams
    include ConvenientService::Feature::Standard::Config

    entry :extract_from_url_path
    entry :extract_from_url_query
    entry :extract_from_body

    def extract_from_url_path
      # ...
    end

    def extract_from_url_query
      # ...
    end

    def extract_from_body
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

The same story, once you review the entries' names, you get the idea of what the `RequestParams` feature is about.

It gives the opportunity to extract parameters from the request body and URL path/query.
