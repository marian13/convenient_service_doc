title: Skip `result` call for boolean services
---

Let's check the following [boolean service](/glossary/boolean_service):

```ruby
class IsConnectionActive
  include ::ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  attr_reader :connection

  def initialize(:connection)
    @connection = connection
  end

  def result
    return failure(connection: "can't be blank") if connection.blank?
    return error("Connection `#{connection.id}` is NOT connected") unless connection.connected?
    return error("Connection `#{connection.id}` has NO task") if connection.task.blank?
    return error("Connection `#{connection.id}` task is NOT in progress") unless connection.task.in_progres?

    success
  end
end
```

A common way to run a usual service is like this:

```ruby
# okish
result = IsConnectionActive.result(connection: connection)

if result.success?
  ##
  # `result.data` is processed somehow by the end-user here...
  #
  result.data
else

end
```

Most of the time you will probably work with `result.data` inside `if result.success?` branch.

But that is not the case for the [boolean services](/glossary/boolean_service).

Their `success` calls do NOT accept any data, that is why the previous chunk of code can be written in a shorter form:

```ruby
# better
if IsConnectionActive.success?(connection: connection)

else

end
```
