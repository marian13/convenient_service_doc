title: Service has only one `success`

Most of the time it is relatively easy to follow this rule.

Consider the following service:

```ruby
class BuildDisplayName
  include ::ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  attr_reader :person

  def initialize(person:)
    @person = person
  end

  def result
    return failure(person: "can't be blank") if person.blank?

    success(display_name: "#{person.first_name} #{persom.last_name}")
  end
end
```

It currently has no conditional logic to build the `display_name`.

After a while, our system started to grow and it appears that some people would like to see their pseudo in place of display names.

Let's reflect on that change in the code using a naive approach:

```ruby
class BuildDisplayName
  include ::ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  attr_reader :person

  def initialize(person:)
    @person = person
  end

  def result
    return failure(person: "can't be blank") if person.blank?

    if person.has_pseudonym?
      success(display_name: person.pseudonym)
    else
      success(display_name: "#{person.first_name} #{persom.last_name}")
    end
  end
end
```


Having two `success` calls inside the `result` is what we try to avoid.

Why?

- It encourages future devs to write [deeply nested conditionals](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computer_Programming/Coding_Style/Minimize_nesting).

- It interferes with the [layering of information](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/universal-principles-of/9781592535873/xhtml/ch67.html).

You don't need to know the details of the implementation until it is really necessary.

The code above tells you about pseudonyms too early, even if you are not interested in them.

If you refactor `BuildDisplayName` like this:

```ruby
class BuildDisplayName
  include ::ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def initialize(person:)
    @person = person
  end

  def result
    return failure(person: "can't be blank") if person.blank?

    success(display_name: display_name)
  end

  private

  def display_name
    @display_name ||= person.has_pseudonym? ? person.pseudonym : "#{person.first_name} #{persom.last_name}"
  end
end
```

Then the `result` describes which data it may return and when it is NOT successful, just that.

Only when you are curious about how `display_name` is exactly built, feel free to check private methods.

This is how the [layering of information](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/universal-principles-of/9781592535873/xhtml/ch67.html) works in practice.

Nesting is replaced by a [flat ternary operator](https://blog.codinghorror.com/flattening-arrow-code/).

It is time to have a look at the specs:

```ruby
# spec/services/assert_file_exists_spec.rb
require "spec_helper"

RSpec.describe BuildDisplayName do
  include ConvenientService::RSpec::Matchers::Results

  example_group "class methods" do
    describe ".result" do
      let(:result) { described_class.result(person: person) }

      context "when building of display name is NOT successful" do
        context "when `person` is blank" do
          let(:person) { nil }

          it "returns `failure`" do
            expect(result).to be_failure.with_data(person: "can't be blank").of_service(described_class).without_step
          end
        end
      end

      context "when building of display name is successful" do
        context "when `person` does NOT have pseudonym" do
          let(:person) { Person.new("John", "Doe") }

          it "returns `success` with first name and last name as display name" do
            expect(result).to be_success.with_data(display_name: "John Doe").of_service(described_class).without_step
          end
        end

        context "when `person` has pseudonym" do
          let(:person) { Person.new("John", "Doe", preudonym: "Gorilla") }

          it "returns `success` with pseudonym as display name" do
            expect(result).to be_success.with_data(display_name: "Gorilla").of_service(described_class).without_step
          end
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

As you can see, specs still have two contexts for successful cases and that is completely OK.

Now, we are ready for the conclusion:

A fact that a *Service has only one `success`* actually means that the service calls `success` inside `result` only once.

But that `success` can still have multiple variations of data values, just like `display_name` in `BuildDisplayName` service.
