## What is an error shadowing?

_Error shadowing_ is a hiding of the original cause of the problem.

A common use case may be [always returning a 404 HTTP error code in production](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#rescue), even when the real code is different.

This way you make it a little bit harder for a possible attacker to find security holes in your web application.

A professional [web attacker](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/) may [easily exploit any kind of security vulnerabilities](https://www.kali.org/).

That is why it is so important to be extremely careful.

Please, constantly impove your security skills.

[Securing Rails Applications](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html) and [OWASP: Ruby on Rails Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Ruby_on_Rails_Cheat_Sheet.html) are good places to revisit from time to time.

Also it is popular to [rescue low-level exceptions](https://www.exceptionalcreatures.com/guides/advanced-rescue-and-raise#changing-exceptions) to encapsulate internal details from the end-user.

The following example is taken directly from [the Rails codebase](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v7.0.0/activestorage/lib/active_storage/service/gcs_service.rb#L56):

```ruby
def download_chunk(key, range)
  instrument :download_chunk, key: key, range: range do
    file_for(key).download(range: range).string
  rescue Google::Cloud::NotFoundError
    raise ActiveStorage::FileNotFoundError
  end
end
```

As you can see, the original exception message is dropped and not reused anywhere.

## When does error shadowing happen with services?

Using [Convenient Service](/), you may encounter an error shadowing as well.

But as always, any approach may have advantages and disadvantages.

[To illustrate](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/for-example-synonym) that, check the service below:

```ruby
class MainService
  # ...
  def result
    return error(message: "Something went wrong") unless sub_service_result.success?
    # ...
    success
  end

  private

  def sub_service_result
    @sub_service_result ||= SubService.result
  end
  # ...
end
```

`MainService` looks innocent, but the problem starts to appear when you execute it.

```ruby
result = MainService.result

result.success?
# => false

result.message
# => "Something went wrong"
```

`result.message` does NOT help to figure out what is actually wrong.

`SubService` is failing in reality, but it is NOT reflected in the outside world in any way.

If you don't want to intentionally confuse the service users or hide the internals from them, prefer to forward the original message.

```ruby
class MainService
  # ...
  def result
    # highlight-start
    return error(message: "Something went wrong (#{sub_service_result.message})") unless sub_service_result.success?
    # highlight-end
    # ...
    success
  end
  # ...
end
```

It is also OK to immediately return `SubService` result when you don't need to provide any additional text to its message, since it also avoids error shadowing.

```ruby
class MainService
  # ...
  def result
    # highlight-start
    return sub_service_result.message unless sub_service_result.success?
    # highlight-end
    # ...
    success
  end
  # ...
end
```

But the best option is to utilize the `step` macro.

It works as the previous example under the hood and when used frequently - helps to forget about error shadowing in the context of services completely.

```ruby
class MainService
  # highlight-start
  step SubService
  # highlight-end
  # ...
  def result
    # highlight-start
    # This line is removed...
    # highlight-end
    # ...
    success
  end
  # ...
end
```

:::note

If you are not safisfied how `step` automatically prevents error shadowing - consider to create a plugin to extend/modify it.
