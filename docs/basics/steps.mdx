## What is a step?

After a while service logic may grow into more complicated and less straightforward.

Therefore, a future developer spends more time trying to figure out what is going on.

That is probably an inevitable process since:

> Complex problem can not have non-complex solution in a global sense.
>
> But a particular step (piece) from that solution can be simple.
>
> â€” Own savvy

That is what steps are all about.

As soon as you start to see that service logic becomes too difficult to digest for a minute or two.

It is a clear sign that you need to split it into multiple sub-services and combine them back into a step sequence.

This is how it looks in practice:

```ruby
class PurchaseBook
  # ...
  step AuthenticateUser, in: :user_id, out: :user
  step SearchBooks, in: [:title, :author_id], out: [:book, :count]
  step VerifyPaymentMethod, in: :user
  step CalculatePrice in: :book, out: {price: :price_without_discount}
  step ApplyDiscounts, in: [:book, {price: :price_without_discount}], out: {price: :price_with_discount}
  # ...
end
```

For the sake of completeness, here is the same service, but without steps:

```ruby
class PurchaseBook
  # ...
  def result
    authenticate_user_result = AuthenticateUser.result(user_id: user_id)

    return authenticate_user_result unless authenticate_user_result.success?

    user = authenticate_user_result.data[:user]

    search_book_result = SearchBook.result(title: title, author_id: author_id)

    return search_book_result if search_book_result.not_success?

    # NOTE: One service may return multiple values if needed.
    book = search_book_result.data[:book]
    count = search_book_result.data[:count]

    verify_payment_method = VerifyPaymentMethod.result(user: user)

    return verify_payment_method unless verify_payment_method.success?

    calculate_price_result = CalculatePrice.result(book: book)

    return calculate_price_result if calculate_price_result.not_success?

    # NOTE: Aliasing `data[:price]` to `price_without_discount`.
    price_without_discount = calculate_price_result.data[:price]

    apply_discounts_result = ApplyDiscounts.result(book: book, price: :price_without_discount)

    return apply_discounts_result unless apply_discounts_result.success?

    # NOTE: Aliasing `data[:price]` to `price_with_discount`.
    price_with_discount = apply_discounts_result.data[:price]
    # ...
  end
end
```

Looks pretty impressive, isn't it?

So steps are just regular services, but their [declarative interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) hides the [boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code).

They are executed in the same order as they are defined.

If any intermediate step service result is not successful, the step sequence is stopped, and that unsuccessful result is returned (similar to [Railway Oriented Programming](https://vimeo.com/97344498)).
