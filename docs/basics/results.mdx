## Motivation behind results

[Usually](https://www.toptal.com/ruby-on-rails/rails-service-objects-tutorial), the service exposes a sole public method, let it be `call` for this case.

```ruby
class Service
  def call
    # ...
  end
end
```

Since Ruby is a [dynamic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language), `call` may return any type of value.

Sometimes it is advantageous, for things like [Duck Typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing), [Abstract Factories](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory), [Null Objects](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/null_object), etc.

But occasionally it may also become problematic.

For example, you can not implement a unified way to check whether the value was calculated correctly (as it was intended by its author).

```ruby
value = service.call

if value.any? # When an array.
if value.cover?(0...100) # Range.
if value.match(/^[0-9]*$/) # Regexp.
if value.dig(:user, :address) # Hash.
if value.nozero? # Integer....
```

:::note

Someone may consider [Object#blank?](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Object.html#method-i-blank-3F) and its opposite [Object#present?](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Object.html#method-i-present-3F) from [ActiveSupport](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_core_extensions.html) as an attempt, but they detect [truthiness](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20663389/12201472) in the Rails sense.

:::

Also it is common to forget to verify if the returned value is actually what you need:

```ruby
hash = service.call

hash.merge(other_hash)
# Expected a merge, but it raises since hash is nil...
```

[Convenient Service](/) suggests utilizing Result objects as a way to overcome the problems listed above.

Practically speaking, to return results from all services.

To express this idea, let's create a different public method instead of `call` and name it `result`.

```ruby
class Service
  def result
    # ...
  end
end
```

Now, we have the following invocation:

```ruby
result = service.result

if result.success?
  result.data
else
  result.message
end
```

## So what is a Result? Its benefits?

_Result_ is a data structure that satisfies the following properties:

- Firstly, it has a consolidated way to detect its state (`success?`, `failure?`, `error?`, and their counterparts with `not` like `not_success?`).

- Secondly, when the result is successful, you can be 100% sure that its data is correct, no additional verifications are needed (the notion of correctness is defined by the service author).

- Moveover, results induce you to always check them, before accessing their attributes, otherwise an exception is raised.

- Also, when something goes wrong, the result contains a description of the reason (`result.message`), which simplifies finding the source of the problem.
