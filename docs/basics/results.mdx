## Motivation behind results

Usually, the service exposes a single public method, let it be `call` for this case.

```ruby
class Service
  def call
    # ...
  end
end
```

Since Ruby is a dynamic language, `call` may return any type of value.

[Sometimes it is advantageous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing), but sometimes it may become problematic.

As a consequence, you can not have a unified way to check whether the value was calculated correctly.

```ruby
value = service.call

if value.any? # When an array.
if value.cover?(0...100) # Range.
if value.match(/^[0-9]*$/) # Regexp.
if value.dig(:user, :address) # Hash.
if value.nozero? # Integer....
```

Also it is common to forget to verify if the returned value is actually what you need:

```ruby
hash = service.call

hash.merge(other_hash)
# Expected a merge, but it raises since hash is nil...
```

Convenient Service suggests utilizing Results objects as a way to overcome the problems listed above.

Let's create a different public method instead of `call` and name it `result`.

```ruby
class Service
  def result
    # ...
  end
end
```

Now, we have the following invocation:

```ruby
result = service.result

if result.success?
  result.data
else
  result.message
end
```

How is it beneficial compared to the previous approach?

- Firstly, it is predictable that all services return results, so there is a consolidated way to detect their state.

- Secondly, when the result is successful, you can be 100% sure that its data is valid.
