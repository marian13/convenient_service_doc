Now, it is the time to describe each result type. Let's start with _errors_.

## What is an error?

_Error_ is a result type caused either by the wrong input data (_validation error_) or by the exceptional behaviour (_exception error_).

In some cases, it may be a validation rule violation, unsatisfied [assertion](https://wiki.c2.com/?ReplaceCommentWithAssertion), or unmet precondition based on the service arguments.

It is a responsibility of a developer/service user to provide correct inputs.

Otherwise, there is no sense in even starting any service processing.

Also errors are often semantically close to the [exceptions](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Exception.html).

In other words, service errors are frequently located at the same places where [exceptions](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Exception.html) are [raised/rescued](https://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_exceptions.html) in the reqular methods.

:::info

Exceptional behaviour like HTTP connection issues, database inconsistencies, timeouts, etc are also errors.

Check out the following example:

```ruby
class EnsureFeatureActive
  # ...
  def initialize(name:)
    @name = name
  end

  def result
    return error("Feature name can NOT be `nil`") if name.nil?
    return error("Unknown feature `#{name}`") unless Feature.exist?(name: name)

    # ... Tricky and non trivial logic to ensure that feature is active...
  rescue Feature::Exceptions::ConnectionTimeout => exception
    return error("Feature `#{name}` connection timeout due to `#{exception.message}`")
  end
end
```

And this is how it can be triggerred:

```ruby
result = EnsureFeatureActive.result(name: "Fancy feature")

if result.error?
  # `result.message` is a string-like object with error reason.
  result.message
end
```

There is no point to involve all the heavy machinery when the feature name is `nil`.

Why do we need to waste any expensive resources if the feature name is unknown?

Can we guarantee whether the feature is actually active when a connection timeout happens?

So, the one of the purposes of the error result is to say that the callers need to make adjustments in their code/config/dependency, not the service authors.
