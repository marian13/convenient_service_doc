Error is a problem that happens during the actual execution of a service.

It can be something usual as HTTP connection issues, database inconsistencies, timeouts, etc.

But the main point to realize - an error prevents the achievement of the service goal.

That is why is so vital to use meaningful names for services.

For instance, when the aim is to schedule a delayed job, call it - `ScheduleDelayedJob`.

When a job was not registered into the queue for whatever reason (except validation, since it is a failure), it should be treated as an error.

Please, read the following code snippet carefully:

```ruby
class ScheduleDelayedJob
  # ...
  def result
    return failure(data: {id: "User id is NOT alphanumeric"}) unless user_id.alphanumeric?

    return error(message: "Queue has no space") if queue.full?
    return error(message: "Job is NOT unique") if job.duplicated?

    job_tracker = ApplicationScheduler.delay(job)

    success(data: {tracker: job_tracker})
  end
end
```

On the contrary, when your objective is just to try to schedule a job, but it does not really important whether it was scheduled or not, the service name should reflect such desire explicitly.

```ruby
class TryToScheduleDelayedJob
  # ...
  def result
    return failure(data: {id: "User id is NOT alphanumeric"}) unless user_id.alphanumeric?

    job_tracker =
      if job.unique? && !queue.full? && !queue.stuck?
        ApplicationScheduler.delay(job)
      else
        ""
      end

    ##
    # Even if the `tracker` is empty, the service still is considered successful.
    # Since the trial is the target, but not the guarantee.
    # `tracker` is more like a metadata here.
    #
    success(data: {tracker: job_tracker})
  end
end
```
