## What is an error?

_Error_ is a problem that happens during the actual execution of a service.

It can be something usual as HTTP connection issues, database inconsistencies, timeouts, etc.

But the main point to realize - an error prevents the achievement of the service goal.

That is why is so vital to use meaningful names for services.

For instance, when the aim is <u>to schedule a delayed job</u>, call it - `ScheduleDelayedJob`.

When a job was not registered into the queue for whatever reason (except validation, since it is a failure), it should be treated as an error.

Please, read the following code snippet carefully:

```ruby
class ScheduleDelayedJob
  # ...
  def result
    return failure(data: {id: "User id is NOT alphanumeric"}) unless user_id.alphanumeric?

    return error(message: "Queue has no space") if queue.full?
    return error(message: "Job is NOT unique") if job.duplicated?

    job_tracker = ApplicationScheduler.delay(job)

    success(data: {tracker: job_tracker})
  end
end
```

In contrast, when your objective is just <u>to try to schedule a job</u>, but it does not really important whether it was scheduled or not, the service name should reflect such desire explicitly.

```ruby
class TryToScheduleDelayedJob
  # ...
  def result
    return failure(data: {id: "User id is NOT alphanumeric"}) unless user_id.alphanumeric?

    job_tracker =
      if job.unique? && !queue.full? && !queue.stuck?
        ApplicationScheduler.delay(job)
      else
        ""
      end

    ##
    # Even if the `tracker` is empty, the service still is considered successful.
    # Since the trial is the target, but not the guarantee.
    # `tracker` is more like a metadata here.
    #
    success(data: {tracker: job_tracker})
  end
end
```

## How to process errors?

Most of the time, handling is the same for all kinds of errors, just like this:

```ruby
result = ScheduleDelayedJob.result

if result.error?
  # `result.message` is a string-like object with error reason.
  send_alert(result.message)
end
```

But when you need to treat them differently, do NOT parse strings, please.

There is the second option `code`, exactly for this purpose, that can be passed to any error calls.

```ruby
# ...
return error(message: "Queue has no space", code: :full_queue) if queue.full?
return error(message: "Job is NOT unique", code: :duplicated_job) if job.duplicated?
# ...

if result.error?
  case result.code # symbol-like object
  when :full_queue
    notify_devops
  when :duplicated_job
    notify_devs
  else
  # ...
end
```
