title: How to use service steps?

## Which types of steps are available?

The two criteria currently categorize steps.

- By action: service and method steps.

- By control flow: `and`, `or`, `not` steps.

## How to define a service step?

You can register existing services as steps of other services using the `step` directive.

Let's have a look at it in practice.

Having the `Service` service.

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

We can use it as a step of the `OtherService` service in the following way.

```ruby
class OtherService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step Service
end
```

This code works almost the same as:

```ruby
class OtherService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    Service.result
  end
end
```

That is why for a single-step service the usage of steps may not seem very beneficial.

So consider a more complex example.

Now we have 3 services.

```ruby
class FooService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

```ruby
class BarService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

```ruby
class BazService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

The `HostService` uses them as steps.

```ruby
class HostService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step FooService
  step BarService
  step BazService
end
```

Rough `HostService` equivalent without steps may be implemented as follows:

```ruby
class HostService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    foo_result = FooService.result

    return foo_result unless foo_result.success?

    bar_result = BarService.result

    return bar_result unless bar_result.success?

    BazService.result
  end
end
```

As you can see, steps allow us to eliminate at least 2 assignments and 2 if-conditionals for this particular example.

Sure, those assignments and if-conditionals are still performed under the hood, but it is no longer a developer's responsibility to manage them.

Now the benefit of steps becomes more obvious, but that is not the only benefit.

Other guides are going to demonstrate the additional simplifications.
