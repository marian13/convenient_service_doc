The `Result#service` method returns the service instance that created its result.

For example:

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

```ruby
result = Service.result
# => <Service::Result status: :success>
```

```ruby
result.service
# => <Service>
```

When the result is bubbled up from a deeply nested step, the `Result#service` method returns a top-level organizer instance.

Let's see it in practice:

```ruby
class TwoLevelsNestedService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

```ruby
class OneLevelNestedService
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step TwoLevelsNestedService
end
```

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step OneLevelNestedService
end
```

```ruby
result = Service.result
# => <Service::Result status: :success>
```

```ruby
result.service
# => <Service>
```

Here, the `TwoLevelsNestedService` creates a `success` result.

Later this result is processed by steps from the `OneLevelNestedService` and `Service` services.

That is why it becomes the `Service` overall result.

```ruby
result.service
# => <Service>
```

Sometimes it may be useful to access the original service instance, e.g. for debugging purposes.

For that reason the `Result#original_service` method is available.

```ruby
result.original_service
# => <TwoLevelsNestedService>
```
