For some rare cases, it may be useful to have a way to call a method skipping all its middlewares.

Consider the following example.

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

To make it more illustrative, let's add a simple middleware that just prints some text before and after calling the original `result`.

```ruby
class Middleware < ConvenientService::MethodChainMiddleware
  def next(...)
    puts "Before calling `#{method}`..."

    value = chain.next(...)

    puts "After calling `#{method}`..."

    value
  end
end
```

This is how it can be registered.

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  middlewares :result, scope: :class do
    use Middleware
  end

  def result
    success
  end
end
```

So now, when we invoke `Service.result`, additional logs are printed.

```ruby
result = Service.result
# Before calling result...
# After calling result...
# => <Service::Result status: :success>
```

But there is still a possibility to call it without middlewares like so:

```ruby
result = Service.result_without_middlewares
# => <Service::Result status: :success>
```

:::note

When the original method ends with `?`, like `success?`, the corresponding skipping method is `success_without_middlewares?`.

The same rule is applicable for methods with trailing `!`.

`bar!` -> `bar_without_middlewares!`.

Keep in mind that the ability to skip middlewares is present just for debugging purposes.

There are NO common use cases for the production business code with it.
