title: How to pass a value to step from class/instance scope?
---

Let's consider the following service:

```ruby
class Service
  # ...

  step EscapeRegexp, \
    in: {pattern: ???}, # `???` is just a placeholder here, it is not a valid Ruby syntax.
    out: :escaped

  # ...
end
```

We need to pass `ENV["PATH_PATTERN"]` to the `EscapeRegexp` step as the `pattern` param.

How that can be achievable?

There are multiple ways:

- Using [raw](/api/plugins/service/has_result_steps).

  ```ruby
  step EscapeRegexp, \
    in: {pattern: raw(ENV["PATH_PATTERN"])},
    out: :escaped
  ```

  This is how `step` call is "translated" to regular service invocation under the hood:

  ```ruby
  def step_result
    @step_result ||= EscapeRegexp.result(pattern: ENV["PATH_PATTERN"])
  end
  ```

  Since [raw](/api/plugins/service/has_result_steps) is a [class method](https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubyref/language/methods-def.html#scope) you can pass it anything from the enclosing class scope.

  The value is forwarded without any intermediate processing.

  ```ruby
  step EscapeRegexp, \
    in: {pattern: raw(any_class_method)},
    out: :escaped
  ```

- Using [proc form](/api/plugins/service/has_result_steps).

  ```ruby
  step EscapeRegexp, \
    in: {pattern: ->{ ENV["PATH_PATTERN"] }},
    out: :escaped
  ```

  The [proc form](/api/plugins/service/has_result_steps) does not additionally process the passed value as well, but it is evaluated in the instance scope.

  So you can access any service instance methods in it.

  ```ruby
  step EscapeRegexp, \
    in: {pattern: ->{ any_instance_method }},
    out: :escaped
  ```
