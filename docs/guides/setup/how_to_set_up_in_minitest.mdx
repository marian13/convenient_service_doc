- Currently [Convenient Service](/) does not have [Minitest](https://github.com/minitest/minitest) extensions ğŸ˜¢.

- But they are planned for subsequent releases ğŸ¥¹.

- As a consequence, the setup process in pretty much the same as for [the regular Ruby project](/guides/setup/how_to_set_up_in_ruby).

- Happy testing!
