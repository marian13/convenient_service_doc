## Log levels

It is possible to configure internal library logging by using the `CONVENIENT_SERVICE_LOGGER_LEVEL` env variable.

It is defaulting to `info`, which is why the majority of the logs are skipped most of the time.

But you can modify this behavior by setting a different [severity level](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger/Severity.html).

Just place the env variable in front of the command that starts your Ruby process which utilizes [Convenient Service](/).

For example:

```bash
CONVENIENT_SERVICE_LOGGER_LEVEL=debug bundle exec rails console
```

Since the [Convenient Service](/) logger is based on the [Ruby stdlib Logger](https://github.com/ruby/logger), it supports the same levels.

Here is the screenshot straight from its official [docs](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html).

:::warning

When your project uses [Ruby stdlib Logger](https://github.com/ruby/logger/tree/v1.2.8.1) with a version older than `1.3.0`, then [log levels as words are not supported yet](https://github.com/ruby/logger/commit/74690b87b15244e19dd91cd06ae295251e1e5781).

Pass numbers in such cases.

```bash
CONVENIENT_SERVICE_LOGGER_LEVEL=0 bundle exec rails console
```

## Colored logs

If you have [Ruby Paint](https://github.com/janlelis/paint#setup) gem as a dependency, and it is [required](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Kernel.html#method-i-require), then `CONVENIENT_SERVICE_LOGGER_ENABLE_COLORS` env variable activates coloring like so:

```bash
CONVENIENT_SERVICE_LOGGER_LEVEL=0 CONVENIENT_SERVICE_LOGGER_ENABLE_COLORS=true bundle exec rails console
```

## Configuration via script

[Convenient Service](/) logger can be accessed inside any Ruby source as well.

For example:

```ruby
ConvenientService.logger.level = Logger::INFO
```
