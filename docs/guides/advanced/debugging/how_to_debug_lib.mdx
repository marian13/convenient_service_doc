[Convenient Service](/) has already more than [5000 unit and integration tests](https://github.com/marian13/convenient_service/tree/main/spec).

That is not the end, more specs are constantly added to [cover](https://coveralls.io/github/marian13/convenient_service?branch=main) even the craziest cases.

But since it is relatively a new library something unpredicatable may still happen.

Prefer to [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/marian13/convenient_service/issues), when you encounter unexpected behavior.

However, if you are curious and enthusiastic enough, you can always try to dive deep and debug [the "nifty" inner parts](https://github.com/marian13/convenient_service) by yourself.

- First of all, navigate to the directory with a project that uses [Convenient Service](/) as a dependency.

  ```bash
  cd your_project
  ```

  In other words, you have it in your project [Gemfile](https://bundler.io/guides/gemfile.html) like so:

  <CodeBlock language="ruby" title="Gemfile">
    {`gem "convenient_service", "~> ${version}"`}
  </CodeBlock>

- Make sure [Convenient Service](/) is [installed](/installation).

  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

- Open the gem source. Set the [EDITOR env variable](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/$EDITOR_variable) to your favorite code editing tool. The command below uses [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

  ```bash
  EDITOR=code bundle open convenient_service
  ```

- Select any file you need and place a debugger call in it.

  The following example utilizes [byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug).

  <img src={useBaseUrl('img/guides/advanced/how_to_debug_lib/byebug.png')} />

- Start your project ([irb console](https://github.com/ruby/irb), [Rails server](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#bin-rails-server), [RSpec suite](https://manny.codes/7-ways-to-selectively-run-rspec-tests/), [Rake tasks](https://ruby.github.io/rake/)) to trigger the code that seems to be broken.

- Happy debugging!

  :::danger

  Do not forget to erase the debugger call once finished debugging.

  :::caution

  [binding.pry](https://github.com/pry/pry) is an amazing instrument, but is NOT a [debugger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger), it is a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).

  [REPL](https://replit.com/languages/ruby) has a completely different purpose, it can enhance the debugger, but not replace it.

  [A casual REPL does not support even half of the possibilities](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/irb/rdoc/IRB.html) that a mature debugger provides.

  Just to name some of them, [line-by-line debugging, up and down stack navigation, dynamic breakpoints](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug/blob/master/GUIDE.md), etc.

  Don't like [byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug) since it does not highlight the syntax ðŸ¤¦? Then [this gist is for you](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66809857/12201472).

  Still don't like [byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug)? Use [binding.break](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70104440/12201472) - a modern debugger developed by [the Ruby core team](https://github.com/ruby/debug).
