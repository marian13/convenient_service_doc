title: Assigns attributes in constructor using Dry::Initializer
---

It is so common to write [constructors](https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/UsersGuide/rg/objinitialization.html) and [attributes](https://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_classes.html) in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) like so:

```ruby
class FormatHeader
  include ApplicationService::Config

  attr_reader :parsed_content, :skip_frozen_string_literal

  def initialize(parsed_content:, skip_frozen_string_literal: false)
    @parsed_content = parsed_content
    @skip_frozen_string_literal = skip_frozen_string_literal
  end
  # ...
end
```

If [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is your [day-to-day language](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages), such code probably seems too [routine](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/routine) for you.

```ruby
class RunShell
  include ApplicationService::Config

  attr_reader :command, :debug

  def initialize(command:, debug: false)
    @command = command
    @debug = debug
  end
  # ...
end
```

Also, it is [so annoying to make accidental typos](https://github.com/aemkei/jsfuck), when you are already tired, but you still have some stuff to complete.

For example, the word `command` is typed 4 times in the example above, so there are 4 opportunities to make an automatic mistake.

Please, don't even tell that [your IDE handles that for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/xeepud/dont_always_trust_what_your_ide_tells_you/).

When the whole team is feeling the same annoyance.

All of the members really believe in the benefits of the removal of such repeatable code.

You may consider to utilizing the [Dry::Initializer](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-initializer/3.0/params-and-options/) integration that the [AssignsAttributesInConstructor::UsingDryInitalizer](/api/plugins/common/assigns_attributes_in_constructor/using_dry_initializer) plugin provides.

```ruby
module ApplicationService
  module Config
    def self.included(service_class)
      service_class.class_exec do
        include ConvenientService::Standard::Config
        # ...
        concerns do
          use ConvenientService::Plugins::Common::AssignsAttributesInConstructor::UsingDryInitalizer::Concern
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Thus, `FormatHeader` and `RunShell` can be reduced in the following way:

```ruby
class FormatHeader
  include ApplicationService::Config

  option :parsed_content
  option :skip_frozen_string_literal, default: -> { false }
  # ...
end
```

```ruby
class RunShell
  include ApplicationService::Config

  option :command
  option :debug, default: -> { false }
  # ...
end
```

:::caution

[Dry::Initializer](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-initializer/3.0/params-and-options/) does NOT call `super` in its [initialize](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-initializer/blob/v3.1.1/lib/dry/initializer/mixin/root.rb#L11) implementation.

If it causes problems for you, try to place [AssignsAttributesInConstructor::UsingDryInitalizer](/api/plugins/common/assigns_attributes_in_constructor/using_dry_initializer) closer to the top in the concerns stack.

See [insert_before](https://github.com/Ibsciss/ruby-middleware/tree/v0.4.2#insert-before).

:::danger

Introduce new libraries to the projects only when you have strong arguments and complete ideas about why to do so.

In fast-paced enterprise projects, with a poor onboarding process, simplicity is almost always a better choice.

The simplicity in a sense, that the tech stack should be familiar to the people, who maintain the project for years.

Since you probably won't have a chance to talk with the "one-task" developers while they remember the initial reasoning behind their code.

Moreover, that code is frequently left without any diagrams, documentation, or even tests üòê.
