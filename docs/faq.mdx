## Is it possible to modify the step collection from a callback?

No❗

That is done by design.

One of the main [Convenient Service](/) goals is the representation of the complex logic as a sequence of simple declarative steps.

This idea is completely lost when a callback allows modification of step collection.

Right after the first such mutation, you can not rely on what you see.

In order to make sure, that the steps declared at the build time are actually the same at runtime, you need to check implementation of every callback.

This contradicts the [Clean Code](/glossary/clean_code) definition.

```ruby
class Service
  include ConvenientService::Standard::Config

  step :one

  step :two

  step :three

  before :step do
    byebug

    steps.clear
    # => FrozenError
  end

  def one
    puts "one"

    success
  end

  def two
    puts "two"

    success
  end

  def three
    puts "three"

    success
  end
end

Service.result
```

## What is the purpose of `ConvenientService::Standard::V1::Config`?

[Convenient Service](/) is a young library in the constant process of polishing its public interface.

As a result, some breaking changes may still happen.

[ConvenientService::Standard::V1::Config](/glossary/advanced/standard_v1) is a config that was created to delay the migration of services that were created by older [Convenient Service](/) versions.

Specifically, `v0.12.0` and lower.

## Why `case/when` does NOT work with just result codes?

Sometimes it may feel idiomatic to check the result code in the following way:

```ruby
# wrong
if result.not_success?
  case result.code # `result.code` returns fancy object
  when :full_queue
    notify_devops
  when :duplicated_job
    notify_devs
  else
    # ...
  end
end
```

Although this snippet looks very appealing, it won't work as expected.

A lot of Ruby folks often have an assumption that a value of `case` is compared with a value of `when`.

```ruby
case value === when value
```

In other words, the `case/when` from example above can be transformed to `if/else` like so:

```ruby
# wrong
if result.not_success?
  if result.code === :full_queue
    notify_devops
  elsif result.code === :duplicated_job
    notify_devs
  else
    # ...
  end
end
```

But, that is NOT correct.

In reality, the value of `when` is [always compared](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4467823/12201472) with the value of `case`.

```ruby
when value === case value
```

Let's write the proper transformation:

```ruby
# okish
if result.not_success?
  if :full_queue === result.code
    notify_devops
  elsif :duplicated_job === result.code
    notify_devs
  else
    # ...
  end
end
```

[Symbol#===](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Symbol.html#method-i-3D-3D-3D) is just an alias to [Symbol#==](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/Symbol.html#method-i-3D-3D).

There is no way to hook into any behavior like with strings ([String#===](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/String.html#method-i-3D-3D-3D) calls [to_str](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/String.html#method-i-to_str) on its argument).

As a result, just `case result.code` is not enough.

But once you use `case result.code.to_sym`, the natural Ruby charm is back.

```ruby
# ok
if result.not_success?
  case result.code.to_sym
  when :full_queue
    notify_devops
  when :duplicated_job
    notify_devs
  else
    # ...
  end
end
```
